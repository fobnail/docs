# Fobnail data format

Fobnail uses CBOR (with a few exceptions) for transmitting structured data both
from Fobnail to Attester and from Attester to Fobnail. We use subset of
[RFC7049](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7049) (no tagging and no
extensions).

## EK certificate

EK certificate is transferred as a raw DER. We don't add any more data so there
is no need to wrap it into CBOR.

## AIK

AIK is transferred in TPM format (TPM2B_PUBLIC structure). Re-encoding this into
CBOR would strip essential data. Fobnail needs unmodified TPM2B_PUBLIC to
successfully perform the "make credential" operation which is needed for
credential activation.

## Metadata

Metadata is sent in CBOR-encoded format (also described
[here](https://github.com/fobnail/docs/blob/main/dev-notes/metadata.md) in more
detail). Example metadata looks like this (for readability, presented as JSON)

```json
{
    // metadata version, used to detect backward-incompatible changes
    // (major 0, unsigned integer)
    "version": 1,
    // device manufacturer extracted from SMBIOS tables (major 3, UTF-8 string)
    "manufacturer": "Gigabyte",
    // device model extracted from SMBIOS tables (major 3, UTF-8 string)
    "model": "Gigabyte A520 AORUS ELITE",
    // MAC address of primary network card (major 2, byte string)
    "mac": [0xea, 0x96, 0x91, 0x87, 0x26, 0x8d],
    // device serial number extracted from SMBIOS tables (major 3, UTF-8 string)
    "sn": "S21N559B431",
}
```

Metadata is signed by Attester using AIK before sending (see
[Data signing](#data-signing) section below).

## RIM

RIM holds PCR registers (from TPM) which are used for attestation. It doesn't
contain information about the Attester since these are part of metadata. RIM
may contain multiple PCR banks (depending of hash algorithm: SHA-1, SHA-256,
others). Each PCR bank contains bitmap of present PCRs (`pcrs` field) and array
of PCR itself. The LSB of bitmap corresponds to PCR0. RIMs are sent in CBOR:

```json
{
    // PCR update counter, incremented every time when some PCR gets updated.
    "update_ctr": 0,
    // Array of PCR banks (major 4)
    "banks": [
        // First PCR bank
        {
            // Algorithm ID as used by TPMs (TPM2_ALG_* constants from libtss)
            // (major 0, unsigned integer)
            "algo_id": 0xb,
            // Bitmap of present PCRs (major 0, unsigned integer)
            "pcrs": 0xffffffff,
            // Array of PCR registers, each register holds hash corresponding to the
            // type of bank.
            // There must be as many hashes as set bits in "pcrs" field. If
            // these don't match then RIM is considered invalid.
            "pcr": [
                // Size of hash is verified, whether all hashes in a bank have
                // the same size, if these don't match then entire RIM is
                // considered invalid
                [ 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, ... ],
                ...
            ]
        },
        // Another PCR bank (major 5, map)
        {
            "algo_id": 0xb,
            "pcrs": 0x000000ff,
            // major 4 (array)
            "pcr": [
                // major 2 (byte string)
                [ 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, ... ],
                ...
            ]
        }
    ],
}
```

RIM is signed by Attester using AIK before sending (see
[Data signing](#data-signing) section below).

## Data signing

Signature is generated by taking an already CBOR-encoded object, a nonce
(generated by Fobnail and sent as part of request) and signing hash of them
both. Nonce is appended to CBOR as plain bytes. Resulting signature and original
data (without nonce) is wrapped into another CBOR object:

```json
{
    // The data we signed (nested CBOR, without nonce)
    // major 2 (byte array)
    "data": [0x42, ...],
    // The signature we just computed (major 2, byte array)
    "signature": [0x20, ...]
}
```
